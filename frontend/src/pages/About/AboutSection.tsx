          I'm Sh√©a, a software engineer, with a passion for building products.
          Blending the art of design with the science of programming, my goal is
          to create intuitive and aesthetic applications that focus on the user
          experience.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mt={2} variant='h4'>
          I'm currently a software engineer at Project Ark, where I work on
          building a platform that helps landlords and tenants manage their
          properties with a focus on community.
        </Typography>
        <Typography mt={2} variant='h4'>
          I'm also a freelance developer, where I am currently working on client
          projects and building my portfolio.
